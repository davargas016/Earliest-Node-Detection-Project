This is a project to see the earliest time for two robots to meet at the same node.  
The input is taken through the command line.
This project utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the quickest path to a common node between the two robots.  
Inputs should be formatted like this:
x y 
j k z

x = number of nodes in the graph
y = number of edges
j = node 1 in relationship
k = node 2 in relationship
z = time it takes to travel from node to node
